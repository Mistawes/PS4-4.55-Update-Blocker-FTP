-----More Info-----


The update blocker creates a folder in /update and unlinks the folder **DO NOT REMOVE IT**
You WILL still get the notifcation of a update let the update download to %100 then 
you will be greeted with a "Cannot download" message and you cannot install it either
so now you cannot update it accidentally...
 
You can use my website to inject it without injecting it via PC
